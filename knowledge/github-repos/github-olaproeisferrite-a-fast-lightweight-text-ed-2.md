Ferrite

A fast, lightweight text editor for Markdown, JSON, YAML, and TOML files. Built with Rust and egui for a native, responsive experience.

⚠️

Platform Note:
Ferrite has been primarily developed and tested on
Windows
. While it should work on Linux and macOS, these platforms have not been extensively tested. If you encounter issues, please
report them
.

🛡️ Antivirus False Positives

Some antivirus software (particularly Windows Defender) may flag Ferrite as suspicious.
This is a false positive.
Here's why it happens and what we've done about it:

Why This Happens

Live Pipeline feature
: Ferrite's pipeline feature lets you pipe document content through shell commands (like
jq
or
grep
). This uses
cmd.exe /C
on Windows, which ML-based antivirus detection can mistake for trojan behavior.

Rust compilation patterns
: Rust binaries can trigger heuristic detections due to their unique compilation characteristics.

What We've Done

Reported to Microsoft
: We've submitted Ferrite to Microsoft's Security Intelligence portal as a false positive (January 2026).

Adjusted build settings
: We've modified our release profile to avoid patterns that trigger ML detection (disabled symbol stripping, switched from size to speed optimization).

Open source transparency
: All code is publicly auditable at
github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite
.

If You're Affected

If Windows Defender quarantines Ferrite:

Verify the source
: Only download from
official GitHub releases

Add an exclusion
: Windows Security → Virus & threat protection → Exclusions → Add the Ferrite executable

Check VirusTotal
: Upload the file to
VirusTotal
- legitimate Ferrite builds should show clean or near-clean results from most scanners

Ferrite does
NOT
access passwords, browser data, or make network connections. The application is fully offline and only accesses files you explicitly open.

🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This project is 100% AI-generated code. All Rust code, documentation, and configuration was written by Claude (Anthropic) via
Cursor
with MCP tools.

About the AI workflow

My Role

Product direction
— Deciding what to build and why

Testing
— Running the app, finding bugs, verifying features

Review
— Reading generated code, understanding what it does

Orchestration
— Managing the AI workflow effectively

The Workflow

Idea refinement
— Discuss concepts with multiple AIs (Claude, Perplexity, Gemini Pro)

PRD creation
— Generate requirements using
Task Master

Task execution
— Claude Opus handles implementation (preferring larger tasks over many subtasks)

Session handover
— Structured prompts maintain context between sessions

Human review
— Every handover is reviewed; direction adjustments made as needed
